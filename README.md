# üïπÔ∏è dodgemaster_adaptive_npc

This project is a 2D Unity game where a villain learns to dodge incoming balls using a single-layer perceptron. The perceptron is a simple AI model that takes 4 inputs ‚Äî ball type, distance, speed, and success of the last dodge ‚Äî and predicts whether the villain should dodge or stay still.

## How It Works:
- Initially, the villain does not dodge and takes hits from damaging balls (Red/Blue).

- After being hit by damaging balls, the villain "learns" to dodge using data collected from those encounters.

- The perceptron dynamically updates its weights based on whether the villain successfully dodges or fails.

- The villain is given a kickstart after some hits to trigger dodging behavior and then the perceptron fine-tunes itself with every new encounter, gradually enhancing dodge accuracy.


## üöÄ Features

üéÆ Player Movement and Shooting

- Control the player using W, A, S, D keys to move:

- W ‚Äì Move Up, A ‚Äì Move Left, S - Move Down, D - Move Right
  
- Press Spacebar to shoot the selected ball in the direction the player is facing.

üéØ Ball Types and Selection:

- üü¢ Green Ball ‚Äì No Damage (No dodge)

- üî¥ Red Ball ‚Äì Damage (Triggers learning and dodge)

- üîµ Blue Ball ‚Äì Damage (Triggers learning and dodge)

- Press G for Green, R for Red, and B for Blue to select the ball.

- Press Spacebar to shoot the selected ball.

üß† AI-Driven Villain Dodging:

- Villain initially takes hits from damaging balls and learns after multiple hits.

- Dynamically decides whether to dodge or not using a single-layer perceptron.

- Perceptron predicts dodge success based on ball type, distance, speed, and previous dodge outcomes.

üïπÔ∏è Collision and Training Logic:

- Detects collision with different ball types.

- Updates perceptron weights after each successful or failed dodge.

## üì• Clone and Run

```
# Clone the repo
https://github.com/rupamonly/dodgemaster_adaptive_villain.git

# Move to project directory
cd dodgemaster_adaptive_villain

```
üéÆ Open in Unity
- Open Unity Hub -> Click on Open -> Select the cloned project folder

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Game
- Click File ‚Üí Build Settings

- Set the target platform to PC, Mac & Linux Standalone (or any desired platform)

- Click Play in the Unity Editor to run the game


## üìö Usage Instructions

Unity Version Compatibility
- Ensure that Unity 2022.3.41f LTS or any other version is installed.

Auto-Generated Folders and Files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Several folders and files are not included in the repository due to their large size or auto-generated nature. Unity will regenerate these automatically when you open the project. These include:

- Library ‚Äì Stores cached and temporary data.

- Logs ‚Äì Contains logs for debugging and performance tracking.

- ProjectSettings ‚Äì Contains project-specific settings (input mappings, quality settings, etc.).

- UserSettings ‚Äì Stores user-specific settings that do not affect other developers.

- .vs, .sln, and Assembly-CSharp.csproj ‚Äì Generated for Visual Studio or other IDEs.

Regenerating Missing Files
- When you open the project in Unity:

- Unity will automatically create the missing folders (Library, - Logs, etc.) based on the current project configuration.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è Single-Layer Perceptron

- The system uses a basic perceptron with limited learning capacity. It is unable to handle non-linearly separable data, which limits its ability to handle complex scenarios.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Input Features

- The perceptron only considers four inputs: ball type, distance, speed, and previous dodge success. This restricts its decision-making capabilities and overlooks additional factors that could enhance performance.

‚ö†Ô∏è No Persistent Memory

- The perceptron resets after every game session, meaning the learning progress is lost when the game restarts. Persistent learning or model saving is not yet implemented.

‚ö†Ô∏è Random Dodge Direction

- The villain‚Äôs dodge direction is randomized (left or right), which may lead to inconsistent or suboptimal dodge behavior.

## üìà Future Scope
- Upgrade to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to handle more complex decision-making scenarios.

- Implement persistent learning to retain perceptron training across game sessions.

- Add the ability to track and process multiple objects for more realistic gameplay.

- Introduce an optimized dodge algorithm to determine the most effective direction dynamically.

- Enhance visual effects and animations to improve the overall gaming experience.
